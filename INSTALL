Installing Cartopy
==================

Pre-built binaries
------------------

The easiest route to installing cartopy is through 
`Conda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_. For all platforms
installing cartopy can be done with::

    conda install -c conda-forge cartopy

Additional options include:
 * `Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/>`_.
 * Christoph Gohlke (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
   maintains unofficial Windows binaries of cartopy.
 * `OSGeo Live <https://live.osgeo.org>`_.


Building from source
--------------------

The latest release of Cartopy is available from
https://github.com/SciTools/Cartopy.

Once you have satisfied the requirements detailed below, simply run::

    python setup.py install

For non-standard locations, additional build lib & include paths
can be provided as per-usual at build_ext phase::

    python setup.py build_ext -I/path/to/include -L/path/to/lib
    python setup.py install


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
These external packages are required to install Cartopy or gain access to
significant Cartopy functionality.

Many of these packages are available in Linux package managers
such as aptitude and yum. For example, it may be possible to install
Numpy using::

    apt-get install python-numpy

If you are installing dependencies with a package manager on Linux,
you may need to install the development packages (look for a "-dev"
suffix) in addition to the core packages.

Many of these dependencies are built as part of Cartopy's conda distribution.
The recipes for these can be found at https://github.com/conda-forge/feedstocks.
