Installing Cartopy
==================

Conda pre-built binaries
------------------------

The easiest way to install Cartopy is through 
`Conda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_. If conda is already installed, installation is as easy as::

    conda install -c conda-forge cartopy


Other pre-built binaries
------------------------

Additional pre-built binaries can be found at a variety of sources, including:
 * `Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/>`_.
 * Christoph Gohlke (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
   maintains unofficial Windows binaries of cartopy.
 * `OSGeo Live <https://live.osgeo.org>`_.


Building from source
--------------------

Before building Cartopy from source, you need to **first** install the required dependencies listed below. Once these are installed, Cartopy can be installed using the pip installer::

    pip install cartopy

To instead install the most recent version found on the GitHub master branch, use::

    pip install git+https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy.git --no-binary cartopy

Alternatively, you can clone the git repo on your computer and install using the `setup.py` file::

    git clone https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy.git
    cd cartopy
    # Uncomment the following line to specify non-standard include and library paths
    # python setup.py build_ext -I/path/to/include -L/path/to/lib
    python setup.py install


Required dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to install Cartopy, or to access it's basic functionality, it will be necessary to first install **geos**, **numpy**, **cython**, **shapely**, **pyshp** and **six**. Many of these packages can be installed using pip or other package managers such as apt-get (linux) and brew (macos). Many of these dependencies are built as part of Cartopy's conda distribution, and the recipes for these can be found at https://github.com/conda-forge/feedstocks.

For macOS, the required dependencies can be installed in the following way::

    brew install proj geos
    pip3 install --upgrade cython numpy pyshp six
    # shapely needs to be build from source. If it is already installed,
    # uninstall it by: pip3 uninstall shapely
    pip3 install shapely --no-binary shapely

If you are installing dependencies with a package manager on Linux, you may need to install the development packages (look for a "-dev" suffix) in addition to the core packages.
