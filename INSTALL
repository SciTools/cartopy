Installation
============

Cartopy (as of v0.22+) provides binary wheels for most major operating systems.
The easiest way to install Cartopy is::

    pip install cartopy

Other binaries
--------------

Additional pre-built binaries can be found at a variety of sources, including:

* `Conda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_
* Christoph Gohlke (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
  maintains unofficial Windows binaries of cartopy.
* `OSGeo Live <https://live.osgeo.org>`_.

Building from source
--------------------

Before building Cartopy from source, you need to **first** install the
required dependencies listed below. Once these are installed, Cartopy can be
installed using the pip installer::

    pip install cartopy

To instead install the most recent version found on the GitHub main branch,
use::

    pip install git+https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy.git

Alternatively, you can clone the git repo on your computer and install manually
using the `setup.py` file::

    git clone https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy.git
    cd cartopy
    # Uncomment the following to specify non-standard include and library paths
    # python setup.py build_ext -I/path/to/include -L/path/to/lib
    python setup.py install

Required dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install Cartopy, or to access its basic functionality, it will be
necessary to first install the required dependencies listed below.
These packages can be installed using pip.

We include a conda environment file that contains a list of all the
dependencies required to build and install cartopy, which can be used to
install pre-built binaries of all the dependencies on your local system.
To use it::

    git clone https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy.git
    cd cartopy
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate cartopy-dev
    pip install -e .

Further information about the required dependencies can be found here:

Optional Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make the most of Cartopy by enabling additional functionality, you may want
to install these optional dependencies. They are also included in some of the
optional groups when installing. For example, use `pip install .[ows]` to install
the optional OWS libraries.
