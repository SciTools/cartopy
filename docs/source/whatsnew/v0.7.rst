Version 0.7 (March 21, 2013)
============================

* Carwyn Pelley added support for 2D arrays of points to :meth:`cartopy.crs.CRS.transform_points`. (:pull:`192`)
* Phil Elson added control for the gridlines and tick labels drawn with
  :meth:`cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.gridlines`. (:pull:`238`)

This is a quick release which targets two very specific requirements. The goals outlined in the development plan at
``v0.6`` still remain the primary target for ``v0.8`` and beyond.
