Version 0.16 (February 21, 2018)
================================

Features
--------

* We are very pleased to announce that Ryan May has been added to the cartopy
  core development team. Ryan (@dopplershift) brings a wealth of experience,
  and has already made significant contributions to the Matplotlib interface,
  extended projections, and helped modernise the development infrastructure.

* The :class:`~cartopy.crs.Gnomonic` projection was brought up-to-date to
  include the ``central_longitude`` argument. (:pull:`855`)

* Ryan May improved the formulation of the boundary ellipse for the
  :class:`~cartopy.crs.Geostationary` projection and added the
  ``sweep_angle_axis`` keyword argument. (:pull:`890`, :pull:`897`)

* Elliott Sales de Andrade made a number of micro-optimisations to the
  Matplotlib interface, fixed a number of documentation issues with
  Python 3 and added Matplotlib 2.0 & 2.1 compatibility. (:pull:`886`,
  :pull:`901`, :pull:`780`, :pull:`773`, :pull:`977`)

* Tick padding was added to the gridliner.
  :data:`cartopy.mpl.gridliner.Gridliner.xpadding` and
  :data:`~cartopy.mpl.gridliner.Gridliner.ypadding` relate. (:pull:`783`)

* Ryan May added the :meth:`~cartopy.feature.NaturalEarthFeature.with_scale`
  method to the NaturalEarthFeature class.
  For example, it is now possible to access higher resolution land features
  with ``cartopy.feature.LAND.with_scale('50m')``. In addition to this,
  :data:`cartopy.feature.STATES` was added to easily access administrative
  area boundaries that were previously only accessible by manually
  constructing :class:`~cartopy.feature.NaturalEarthFeature` instances
  (as is done in the
  :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_lines_and_polygons_feature_creation.py` example).
  (:pull:`898`)

* Daryl Herzmann and Robert Redl improved cartopy's internal conversion
  between Shapely objects and Matplotlib Paths. (:pull:`885` & :pull:`1021`)

* Åsmund Steen Skjæveland fixed :meth:`cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.tissot`
  to use the documented units of kilometres, where before it had been using
  metres. (:pull:`904`)

* Andrew Dawson wrote a new tutorial for the user guide:
  :ref:`understanding_transform`. (:pull:`914`)

* Daniel Kirkham and Daryl Herzmann made significant improvements to the
  stability of polygon transformation. The changes reduce the frequency
  of messages such as
  ``Unidentified problem with geometry, linestring being re-added`` and
  ``Self-intersection at or near point <X> <Y>`` occurring.
  (:pull:`974` and :pull:`903`)

* Chris Holdgraf and Corinne Bosley worked collaboratively to bring
  `sphinx-gallery <https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery>`_ to the
  cartopy docs. (:pull:`969`)

* Ray Bell neatened up many of the examples to explicitly pass the coordinate
  system when calling :meth:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.set_extent`.
  (:pull:`975`)

* Ryan May changed the default zorder of LAND and OCEAN to -1, thus fixing
  an issue with LAND/OCEAN appearing above some data elements such as
  vectors. (:pull:`916`)

* Kevin Donkers added the 60 UTM projections example to the gallery
  in :pull:`954`:

.. figure:: ../gallery/miscellanea/images/sphx_glr_utm_all_zones_001.png
   :target: ../gallery/miscellanea/utm_all_zones.html
   :align: center

* Andrey Kiselev added support for reading shapes with a third (Z) dimension.
  (:pull:`958`)

* Corinne Bosley standardised the docstring format for improved readability
  and visual consistency. (:pull:`987`)

* Cartopy now no longer enables :func:`shapely.speedups` at cartopy import
  time. (:pull:`990`)

* Mahé Perrette and Ryan May collaborated to improve the
  :class:`~cartopy.crs.Stereographic` projection. (:pull:`929`)
