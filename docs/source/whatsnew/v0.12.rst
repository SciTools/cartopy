Version 0.12 (April 14, 2015)
=============================

Features
--------

* We are very pleased to announce that Elliott Sales de Andrade was added to the cartopy
  core development team. Elliott has added several new projections in this release, as well
  as setting up cartopy's Python 3 testing on TravisCI and generally improving the cartopy
  codebase.

* Installing cartopy became much easier for conda users. A ``scitools`` channel has been
  added which makes getting cartopy and all of its dependencies on Linux, OSX and
  Windows possible with::

     conda install -c scitools cartopy

* Support for Python 3, specifically 3.3 and 3.4, has been added. Some features that depend
  on OWSLib will not be available as it does not support Python 3.

* Two new projections, :class:`~cartopy.crs.AzimuthalEquidistant` and
  :class:`~cartopy.crs.AlbersEqualArea` have been added. See the :ref:`cartopy_projections`
  for the full list of projections now available in cartopy.

* The Web Map Service (WMS) interface has been extended to support on-the-fly reprojection
  of imagery if the service does not support the projection of the map being drawn.
  The following example demonstrates the process by adding WMS imagery to an Interrupted
  Goode Homolosine map - unsurprisingly this WMS service does not provide IGH imagery, so
  cartopy has had to reproject them from a projection the WMS does support:

  .. figure:: ../gallery/web_services/images/sphx_glr_wms_001.png
     :target: ../gallery/web_services/wms.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70

* Peter Killick added an interface for accessing MapBox tiles using the MapBox
  Developer API. A MapBox client can be created with,
  :class:`~cartopy.io.img_tiles.MapboxTiles` and as with the other imagery from a simple URL
  based imagery service, it can be added to a :class:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes` with the
  :meth:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.add_image` method. The following example demonstrates the
  interface for another source of imagery:

  .. figure:: ../gallery/web_services/images/sphx_glr_image_tiles_001.png
     :target: ../gallery/web_services/image_tiles.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70

* Some improvements were made to the geometry transformation algorithm to improve
  the stability of geometry winding. Several cases of geometries being incorrectly
  inverted when transformed have now been resolved. (:pull:`545`)

* Mark Hedley added the ``central_rotated_longitude`` keyword to
  :class:`cartopy.crs.RotatedPole`, which is particularly useful for limited area
  rotated pole models in areas such as New Zealand:

    .. plot::
       :width: 200pt

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import cartopy.crs as ccrs

        rpole = ccrs.RotatedPole(pole_longitude=171.77,
                                 pole_latitude=49.55,
                                 central_rotated_longitude=180)
        fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
        ax = plt.axes(projection=rpole)
        ax.set_global()
        ax.gridlines()
        ax.stock_img()
        ax.coastlines()
        plt.show()

* A new method has been added to the :class:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes` to
  allow control of the neatline of a map drawn with the Matplotlib interface.
  The method, :meth:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.set_boundary`, takes a
  :class:`matplotlib Path<matplotlib.path.Path>` object, which means that
  arbitrary shaped edges can be achieved:

  .. figure:: ../gallery/miscellanea/images/sphx_glr_star_shaped_boundary_001.png
     :target: ../gallery/miscellanea/star_shaped_boundary.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70

* A new SRTM3 RasterSource has been implemented allowing interactive pan/zoom
  of 3 arc-second elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission.
  The SRTM example has also been updated to use the new interface.

* New additions to the gallery:


  .. figure:: ../gallery/miscellanea/images/sphx_glr_un_flag_001.png
     :target: ../gallery/miscellanea/un_flag.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70

  .. figure:: ../gallery/lines_and_polygons/images/sphx_glr_always_circular_stereo_001.png
     :target: ../gallery/lines_and_polygons/always_circular_stereo.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70

  .. figure:: ../gallery/miscellanea/images/sphx_glr_tube_stations_001.png
     :target: ../gallery/miscellanea/tube_stations.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70

  .. figure:: ../gallery/web_services/images/sphx_glr_wms_001.png
     :target: ../gallery/web_services/wms.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70

     :target: ../gallery/web_services/image_tiles.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70


Deprecations
------------
* The SRTM module has been re-factored for simplicity and to take advantage
  of the new :ref:`raster source interface <raster-source-interface>`. Some
  methods have therefore been deprecated and will be removed in future
  releases. The function :func:`cartopy.io.srtm.srtm` has been replaced with
  the :meth:`cartopy.io.srtm.SRTM3Source.single_tile` method. Similarly,
  ``cartopy.io.srtm.srtm_composite`` and
  ``cartopy.io.srtm.SRTM3_retrieve`` have been replaced with the
  :meth:`cartopy.io.srtm.SRTM3Source.combined` and
  :meth:`cartopy.io.srtm.SRTM3Source.srtm_fname` methods respectively.

* The :class:`cartopy.io.RasterSource.fetch_raster` interface has been
  changed such that a sequence of :class:`cartopy.io.LocatedImage` must be
  returned, rather than a single image and its associated extent.

* The ``secant_latitudes`` keyword in :class:`cartopy.crs.LambertConformal` has
  been deprecated in favour of ``standard_parallels``.
