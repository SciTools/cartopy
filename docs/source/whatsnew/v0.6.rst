Version 0.6 (February 19, 2013)
===============================


Features
--------

* Patrick Peglar added the ability to draw ticks for some limited projections
  when using the :py:func:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.gridlines` method on an Axes.

* Phil Elson and Carwyn Pelley extended the cartopy documentation to include
  new tutorials such as :ref:`using_the_shapereader`.

* Ian Edwards :doc:`added a new example <../gallery/miscellanea/favicon>` to create a favicon for cartopy.

* Phil Elson :doc:`added a new example <../gallery/lines_and_polygons/hurricane_katrina>` to show polygon analysis
  and visualisation with Shapely and cartopy.

* Edward Campbell added a new :py:class:`cartopy.crs.EuroPP` projection for UTM zone 32.

* Andrew Dawson added a ``central_longitude`` keyword for the Stereographic family of projections.

* Phil Elson added a :py:class:`~cartopy.io.Downloader` class which allows
  automatic downloading of shapefiles (currently from Natural Earth and GSHHS).
  The extension requires no user action and can be configured via the :data:`cartopy.config` dictionary.

* Development plans for cartopy 0.7 and beyond

    * Improve the projection definitions to support better control over datum definitions
      and consider adding WKT support (:issue:`ticket <153>`).

    * Begin work on vector field support (barbs, quiver, streamlines etc.).

    * Continue identifying and implementing performance enhancements (particularly in contour drawing).

    * Extend the number of projections for which it is possible to draw tick marks.
