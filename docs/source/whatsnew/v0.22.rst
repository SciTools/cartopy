Version 0.22 (August 4, 2023)
=============================

Cartopy v0.22 is a major step forward in the project's development. The
requirement to install with local PROJ and GEOS libraries has been
removed. The previous C PROJ library calls have been replaced by pyproj
and the C GEOS calls have been replaced by shapely. This means that
Cartopy can now be installed with a simple ``pip install cartopy``.

  .. plot::

    import cartopy.crs as ccrs
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    np.random.seed(100)

    x = np.arange(10, 20)
    y = np.arange(0, 10)
    x, y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

    img = np.random.randint(low=0, high=255, size=(10, 10, 4)) / 255

    projection = ccrs.Mollweide()
    transform = ccrs.PlateCarree()
    ax = plt.axes(projection=projection)
    ax.set_global()
    ax.coastlines()

    ax.pcolormesh(np.linspace(0, 120, 11), np.linspace(0, 80, 11), img, transform=transform)

    plt.show()
