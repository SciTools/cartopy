Version 0.25 (August 8, 2025)
=============================

This version contains a lot of maintenance work and updating internal
portions of the code to use more modern Python features and methods.
There was a lot of work done in path transformations to provide more
robust Shapely to Matplotlib Path and vice versa transformations. Additionally,
there are several new projections that were added in this release.

The new minimum supported versions of dependencies that have been updated are:

* Shapely 2.0


üéâ Features
-----------

* Ruth Comer introduced `~cartopy.mpl.path.shapely_to_path` and
  `~cartopy.mpl.path.path_to_shapely` which map a single Shapely geometry or
  collection to a single Matplotlib path and *vice versa*. (:pull:`2455`)

* The Orthographic projection now supports a ``rotation`` keyword argument
  that applies azimuthal rotation to the projection.
  Thanks Ken Hirata for this work. (:pull:`2504`)

* The Spilhaus projection was added by Wenrui Jiang (requires PROJ 9.6+).
  (:pull:`2529`)


üêõ Bug Fixes
------------

* Greg Lucas fixed the image transform code to add a half-pixel shift to
  the y coordinate (the x coordinate was already shifted a half-pixel).
  (:pull:`2461`)

* Ruth Comer fixed cases where a single inverted polygon was being
  projected incorrectly. (:pull:`2470`)

* Transforming multipolygons with holes was improved by Ruth Comer to
  avoid some libgeos errors. (:pull:`2521`)

* Greg Lucas fixed gridline handling of offset central longitudes.
  The gridlines now extend to the edges of the maps. (:pull:`2489`)

* Romain Jolivet fixed a potential initialization error when downloading with
  a PosixPath. (:pull:`2500`)

üìö Documentation
----------------

* Philippe Miron updated the logo to center the Cartopy text. (:pull:`2460`)

* Warrick Ball updated the BibTex citation. (:pull:`2485`)

* Edwin added an example demonstrating how to reproject a raster image.
  :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_scalar_data_raster_reprojections.py` (:pull:`2496`)

* Ruth Comer added an example aligning Cartopy and Matplotlib Axes.
  :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_gridlines_and_labels_map_latitudes.py` (:pull:`2502`)

* Jan Meischner updated the gridliner label example.
  :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_gridlines_and_labels_gridliner.py` (:pull:`2505`)


üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance
--------------

* Greg Lucas changed all internal function calls to prefer the (lon, lat)
  ordering for all inputs and outputs to provide more consistency. (:pull:`2453`)

* Greg Lucas replaced the deprecated ``utcnow()`` calls.

* Miroslav ≈†ediv√Ω updated path and math functions with modern replacements.
  (:pull:`2508` and :pull:`2509`)

* Mattias Cuntz updated the French WFS server addresses for tests.
  (:pull:`2524`)

* Katelyn Fitzgerald updated the Cython code to use ``libc.math`` instead of
  ``numpy.math``. (:pull:`2528`)

* Bill Little updated the license and license-file fields to conform with
  PEP 639. (:pull:`2526`)


üö´ Deprecations and Removals
----------------------------

* The ``cartopy.mpl.clip_path`` module is deprecated without replacement.
  Please vendor these functions if you need them.

* `~cartopy.mpl.patch.path_to_geos` and `~cartopy.mpl.patch.geos_to_path` are
  deprecated.  Use `~cartopy.mpl.path.path_to_shapely` and
  `~cartopy.mpl.path.shapely_to_path` instead.

* `~cartopy.mpl.patch.path_segments` is deprecated without replacement.  The
  implementation is simply

  .. code-block:: python

    pth = path.cleaned(**kwargs)
    return pth.vertices[:-1, :], pth.codes[:-1]
