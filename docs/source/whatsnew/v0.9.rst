Version 0.9 (September 12, 2013)
================================

* We are very pleased to announce that Bill Little was added to the cartopy
  core development team. Bill has made some excellent contributions to cartopy,
  and `his presentation at EuroScipy'13 on
  "Iris & Cartopy" <https://www.euroscipy.org/2013/schedule/presentation/35/>`_
  was voted best talk of the conference.
* Other talks and tutorials during this release cycle include Phil Elson's `talk at SciPy'13
  (with video) <https://pyvideo.org/scipy-2013/iris-cartopy-python-packages-for-atmospheric-a.html>`_,
  `Thomas Lecocq's tutorial at EuroSciPy
  <https://www.euroscipy.org/2013/schedule/presentation/27/>`_
  and a forthcoming `talk at FOSS4G <http://2013.foss4g.org/conf/programme/presentations/29/>`_.
* Christoph Gohlke updated cartopy to support Windows 7.
* The Plate Carree projection was updated to fully handle arbitrary globe definitions.
* Peter Killick updated the Mercator class' default globe to WGS84. His refactor paved the way
  for some follow on work to fully implement the Google Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857) projection.
