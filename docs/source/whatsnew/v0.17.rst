Version 0.17 (November 16, 2018)
================================

For a full list of included Pull Requests and closed Issues, please see the
`0.17 milestone <https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy/milestone/23>`_.

Features
--------
* The :class:`cartopy.feature.NaturalEarthFeature` class now allows a
  :class:`cartopy.feature.AdaptiveScaler` object to be passed as the ``scale``
  argument. This will automatically choose the appropriate feature scale from
  the GeoAxes extent. This can also be used interactively while panning and
  zooming in a figure. :data:`cartopy.feature.NaturalEarthFeature.scale` is
  now read-only. (:pull:`1102`, :pull:`983`)

* Proj version 5.x is now supported in Cartopy, thanks to hard work by
  Elliott Sales de Andrade. As part of making this version work, the inner
  workings and boundaries of many projections were improved.
  (:pull:`1124`, :pull:`1148`) Elliott also improved support for warped
  rectangular projections (:pull:`1180`) as well as added support for the
  Eckert family of projections (:pull:`1168`) and Equal Earth projection.
  (:pull:`1182`)

    .. plot::
       :width: 400pt

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import cartopy.crs as ccrs

        eq_earth = ccrs.EqualEarth()
        fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
        ax = plt.axes(projection=eq_earth)
        ax.set_global()
        ax.gridlines()
        ax.stock_img()
        ax.coastlines()
        plt.show()

* Greg Lucas contributed functionality to plot day/night across the globe,
  which was turned into a map feature by Phil Elson. The shading can be added
  to a map with :data:`cartopy.feature.nightshade.Nightshade(datetime)`. For
  more information, see the
  :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_lines_and_polygons_nightshade.py` example.
  (:pull:`1135`, :pull:`1181`)

.. figure:: ../gallery/lines_and_polygons/images/sphx_glr_nightshade_001.png
   :target: ../gallery/lines_and_polygons/nightshade.html
   :align: center

* Elliott Sales de Andrade added optional support for the use of
  `pykdtree <https://github.com/storpipfugl/pykdtree>`_
  when performing image transformations. This module has been demonstrated to
  be twice as fast as the old code for most of the Cartopy examples, with one
  example (geostationary) having a 95% reduction in run time. (:pull:`1150`)

* Greg Lucas added a Fiona-based shapefile reader. If
  `Fiona <https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona>`_ is installed on
  a user's system, this will now be the default shapefile reader, adding
  significant speed improvements. (:pull:`1000`)

* Phil Elson added the ability to control the appearance of Shapely geometries
  using a function. :func:`cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.add_geometries` gained
  a ``styler`` argument that takes a function that given a geometry, returns a
  dictionary of style keyword arguments. The
  :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_lines_and_polygons_hurricane_katrina.py`
  example has been updated to use this. (:pull:`1019`)

* Kevin Donkers, with help from Phil Elson and Peter Killick, improved the
  interactivity of panning and zooming images by adding a raster
  image cache. (:pull:`1192`, :pull:`1195`, :pull:`1197`)

* Peter Killick and Phil Elson improved the use of Cartopy in Jupyter notebook
  environments by adding an HTML representation for projections. These
  render vector images of the coastlines using a given
  projection to enable a quick preview. (:pull:`951`, :pull:`1196`)

* Fixes were added by Elliott Sales de Andrade to support the Matplotlib 3.x
  series. (:pull:`1130`)

* Ryan May fixed up the `.Geostationary` and `.NearsidePerspective` projections
  as well as added additional options to the Mercator projection.
  (:pull:`1189`, :pull:`1043`)

* Andrey Kiselev contributed support for the Equidistant Conic projection.
  (:pull:`1022`)

    .. plot::
       :width: 400pt

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import cartopy.crs as ccrs

        eq_conic = ccrs.EquidistantConic()
        fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
        ax = plt.axes(projection=eq_conic)
        ax.set_global()
        ax.gridlines()
        ax.stock_img()
        ax.coastlines()
        plt.show()

* Peter Killick updated and improved the interface to Mapbox image tiles.
  (:pull:`1170`)

* Manuel Garrido and Phil Elson collaborated to add support for more themes
  for the Stamen map tile set. (:pull:`1013`, :pull:`1188`)

* Support for WMTS sources was made more robust by Alex Crosby.
  (:pull:`1052`, :pull:`1053`)

* Passing a ``color`` argument to
  :func:`cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.add_feature`
  now overrides default feature ``edgecolor`` and ``facecolor`` thanks to
  a change by Elliott Sales de Andrade. (:pull:`1029`)

* Phil Elson added :func:`cartopy.geodesic.Geodesic.geometry_length` to
  calculated the length in physical meters of any Shapely geometry.
  (:pull:`1096`)

* Elliott Sales de Andrade improved the interpolation code by normalizing
  values, reducing issues due to precision. (:pull:`1042`)

* Ryan May fixed a few corner cases in the plotting and transform code.
  (:pull:`1062`, :pull:`1090`)

* A ``pyproject.toml`` file has been added to Cartopy by
  Elliott Sales de Andrade to make it easier to build Cartopy. Newer
  versions of pip should now automatically install Cython and NumPy before
  trying to build Cartopy. (:pull:`1132`)

* Andrew Dawson fixed a crash when calculating the boundary for the
  Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection. (:pull:`1100`)

* Elliott Sales de Andrade and Andrew Dawson removed the use of deprecated
  functionality in NumPy. (:pull:`1101`, :pull:`1122`)

* Kevin Donkers added all 60 UTM zones to the images in the supported
  projection documentation. (:pull:`1103`)

* Broken URLs to the SRTM imagery were corrected by Elliott Sales de Andrade.
  (:pull:`1143`)

Deprecations
------------
* ``cartopy.mpl.clip_path.clip_path`` has been deprecated. It is a simple
  wrapper for Matplotlib's path clipping, so use that instead. You can replace
  ``clip_path(subject, clip_bbox)`` by ``subject.clip_to_bbox(clip_bbox)``.

* ``cartopy.io.img_tiles.StamenTerrain`` has been deprecated. Use
  ``Stamen('terrain-background')`` instead.

* In CartoPy 0.18, the default value for the ``origin`` argument to
  :func:`cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.imshow` will change from ``'lower'``
  to ``'upper'`` to match the default in Matplotlib.

Incompatible Changes
--------------------
* Support for Matplotlib < 1.5.1 and NumPy < 1.10 has been removed.
