Version 0.24 (October 7, 2024)
==============================

Python 3.13 and Numpy 2 are supported and the new minimum supported versions
of dependencies that have been updated are:

* Python 3.10
* Matplotlib 3.6

Features
--------

* Ryan May fixed some internal usages of PlateCarree coordinates to use geodetic lat/lon
  coordinates of the proper ellipse, improving boundary handling for some projections. (:pull:`2378`)

* Ruth Comer added more improvements to gridlines, including title adjustments to avoid overlaps. (:pull:`2393`)

* Eric Matti fixed an issue with gouraud shading when using wrapped coordinates in a pcolormesh. (:pull:`2401`)

* Raphael Quast added the ability to use multi-path geometries as boundaries of the maps.
  This means that an Axes doesn't have to be fully connected anymore and can be separate
  land masses and avoid the oceans if a user wants. (:pull:`2362`)

* Thibault Hallouin added the Lambert Zone II (epsg:27572) projection, which is widely
  used for maps of mainland France. (:pull:`2427`)
