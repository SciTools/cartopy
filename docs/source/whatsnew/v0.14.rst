Version 0.14 (March 24, 2016)
=============================

Features
--------

* Zachary Tessler and Raj Kesavan added the :class:`cartopy.crs.Sinusoidal` projection,
  allowing MODIS data to be visualised in its native projection. Additionally, a
  prepared :data:`cartopy.crs.Sinusoidal.MODIS` projection has been made available for
  convenience.

* Joseph Hogg and Daniel Atton Beckmann added the :class:`cartopy.geodesic.Geodesic`
  class which wraps the proj.4 geodesic library. This allows users to solve the direct and
  inverse geodesic problems (calculating distances between points etc). It also contains a
  convenience function that returns geodetic circles. This is used by
  :meth:`cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.tissot` which draws Tissot's indicatrices on the axes.

* The SRTM3 data source has been changed to the `LP DAAC Data Pool
  <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data_access/data_pool>`_. The Data Pool is more
  consistent, fixing several missing tiles, and the data is void-filled.
  Consequently, the ``cartopy.srtm.fill_gaps`` function has been deprecated
  as it has no purpose within the STRM context. The
  SRTM example has also been updated to skip the void-filling step.
  Additionally, this data source provides SRTM at a higher resolution of
  1 arc-second, which may be accessed via :class:`cartopy.io.srtm.SRTM1Source`.

* All downloaders will use secure connections where available. Not
  every service supports this method, and so those will use non-secured
  HTTP connections instead. (See :pull:`736` for full details.)

* Cartopy now supports, and is tested against, Matplotlib 1.3 and 1.5 as well as
  NumPy 1.7, 1.8 and 1.10.

* Daniel Eriksson added a new example to the gallery:

  .. figure:: ../gallery/scalar_data/images/sphx_glr_aurora_forecast_001.png
     :target: ../gallery/scalar_data/aurora_forecast.html
     :align: center
     :scale: 70


Deprecations
------------
* ``cartopy.crs.GOOGLE_MERCATOR`` has been moved to :data:`cartopy.crs.Mercator.GOOGLE`.


Incompatible changes
--------------------
* :meth:`cartopy.crs.CRS.transform_point` now issues NaNs when invalid transforms are identified.
