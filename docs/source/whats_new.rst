What's new in cartopy 0.10
**************************

:Release: 0.10.0
:Date:

We are very pleased to announce that Andrew Dawson was added to the cartopy
core development team. In this release Andrew has single-handedly
implemented comprehensive vector transformation and visualisation
capabilities, including: 

* The ability to transform vector fields between different coordinate
  reference systems via the :meth:`~cartopy.crs.CRS.transform_vectors`
  CRS method.

* :meth:`GeoAxes.quiver <cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.quiver>` and
  :meth:`GeoAxes.barbs <cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.barbs>` for arrow and
  barb plotting. More information is available at :ref:`vector_plotting`.

* A regridding function for "regularising" a vector field in the target
  coordinate system. See also
  :func:`cartopy.vector_transform.vector_scalar_to_grid`. Both
  :meth:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.quiver` and
  :meth:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.barbs` accept the ``regrid_shape``
  keyword to trigger this behaviour automatically. 
  
* :meth:`GeoAxes.streamplot <cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.streamplot>` adds
  the ability to draw streamlines in any projection from a vector field in
  any other projection.

* The SRTM IO got some new features: :func:`cartopy.io.srtm.add_shading` adds
  shades on SRTM elevation maps. :func:`cartopy.io.srtm.fill_gaps` might be
  needed if SRTM has gaps, but requires `gdal` to be installed.

What's new in cartopy 0.9
*************************

:Release: 0.9.0
:Date: 12 September 2013

* We are very pleased to announce that Bill Little was added to the cartopy
  core development team. Bill has made some excellent contributions to cartopy,
  and `his presentation at EuroScipy'13 on
  "Iris & Cartopy" <https://www.euroscipy.org/schedule/presentation/35/>`_
  was voted best talk of the conference.
* Other talks and tutorials during this release cycle include Phil Elson's `talk at SciPy'13
  (with video) <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/presentation_detail.php?id=132>`_,
  `Thomas Lecocq's tutorial at EuroSciPy <https://www.euroscipy.org/schedule/presentation/27/>`_
  and a forthcoming `talk at FOSS4G <http://2013.foss4g.org/conf/programme/presentations/29/>`_.
* Christoph Gohlke updated cartopy to support Windows 7.
* The Plate Carree projection was updated to fully handle arbitrary globe definitions.
* Peter Killick updated the Mercator class' default globe to WGS84. His refactor paved the way
  for some follow on work to fully implement the Google Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857) projection.

* The TransverseMercator class saw a tidy up to include several common arguments (:issue:`ticket <309>`)
* Bill Little added the Geostationary projection to allow geolocation of satellite imagery.

* Byron Blay added the :class:`Lambert conformal conic projection <cartopy.crs.LambertConformal>`.


What's new in cartopy 0.8
*************************

:Release: 0.8.0
:Date: 3 June 2013

* Bill Little added support for the OSNI projection and enhanced the image nest capability. (:pull:`263`)
* :class:`cartopy.io.img_nest.Img` has been extended to include a
  :func:`cartopy.io.img_nest.Img.from_world_file` static method for
  easier loading of georeferenced images.
* Phil Elson added a major performance improvement when plotting data from PlateCarree onto a
  PlateCarree map. (:pull:`260`)
* Byron Blay and Richard Hattersley added a :class:`cartopy.crs.Globe` class to encapsulate ellipsoid and optionally
  datum information for CRSs. Globe handling in many projections, including Stereographic, has been added.


What's new in cartopy 0.7
*************************

:Release: 0.7.0
:Date: 21 Mar 2013

* Carwyn Pelley added support for 2D arrays of points to :meth:`cartopy.crs.CRS.transform_points`. (:pull:`192`)
* Phil Elson added control for the gridlines and tick labels drawn with
  :meth:`cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.gridlines`. (:pull:`238`)
* Various documentation enhancements have been added. (:pull:`247`, :pull:`244` :pull:`240` and :pull:`242`)

This is a quick release which targets two very specific requirements. The goals outlined in the development plan at
``v0.6`` still remain the primary target for ``v0.8`` and beyond.


What's new in cartopy 0.6
*************************

:Release: 0.6.0
:Date: 19 Feb 2013

* Patrick Peglar added the ability to draw ticks for some limited projections
  when using the :py:func:`~cartopy.mpl.geoaxes.GeoAxes.gridlines` method on an Axes.

* Phil Elson and Carwyn Pelley extended the cartopy documentation to include
  new tutorials such as :ref:`using_the_shapereader`.

* Ian Edwards :doc:`added a new example <examples/favicon>` to create a favicon for cartopy.

* Phil Elson :doc:`added a new example <examples/hurricane_katrina>` to show polygon analysis
  and visualisation with Shapely and cartopy.

* Edward Campbell added a new :py:class:`cartopy.crs.EuroPP` projection for UTM zone 32.

* Andrew Dawson added a ``central_longitude`` keyword for the Stereographic family of projections.

* Phil Elson added a :py:class:`~cartopy.io.Downloader` class which allows
  automatic downloading of shapefiles (currently from Natural Earth and GSHHS).
  The extension requires no user action and can be configured via the :py:data:`cartopy.config` dictionary.


Development plans for cartopy 0.7 and beyond
============================================

* Improve the projection definitions to support better control over datum definitions
  and consider adding WKT support (:issue:`ticket <153>`).

* Begin work on vector field support (barbs, quiver, streamlines etc.).

* Continue identifying and implementing performance enhancements (particularly in contour drawing).

* Extend the number of projections for which it is possible to draw tick marks.

cartopy to encompass common operations, and provide performance
improvements.


Cartopy 0.5 features
====================

A summary of the main features added with version 0.5:

* An improved feature API to support future expansion and
  sophistication, and a wider range of pre-defined Natural Earth
  datasets.


Incompatible changes
--------------------
None

Deprecations
------------
* The method :meth:`Axes.natural_earth_shp()` has been replaced by the

  module.


Feature API
