After a lengthy discussion between Phil Elson and Richard Hattersley culminated
in a belief that it was *actually* possible to write a mapping library which can handle data which crosses the dateline
(or indeed exists in a different coordinate system to the projection of the desired map),
cartopy was born. From such simple beginnings cartopy has grown into a community driven
package with exciting scientific geospatial visualisation capabilities from a simple, pythonic
interface.

The following people have dedicated their time and effort to deliver 
new functionality, fix bugs, review code and provide support for, cartopy, without whom
the package wouldn't be as rich or diverse as it is today:

 * Bill Little
 * Byron Blay
 * Ed Campbell
 * Andrew Munslow
 * Damon McDougall
 * Ian Edwards
 * Carwyn Pelley
 * Andrew Dawson
 * Patrick Peglar


Thank you!
